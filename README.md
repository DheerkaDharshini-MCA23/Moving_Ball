BALL MOVING
Created a ball using style.The ball moment is in X and Y direction.Starting position of the ball is 0px and it move on  a particular direction based on velocity of the ball.If the ball is reached boundary it will return back to the starting position.Here i am using setInterval to call that function continuously in a particular time.
